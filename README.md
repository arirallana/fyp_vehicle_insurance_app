The app has been designed using a Python mobile development framework called Kivy and is runnable on Android and iOS platforms. The process of policy recommendation
to client as well as the detection of fraud in filed claims has been enhanced using machine learning models. The random forest classifier was able to detect with 78.4% accuracy if the application user
filed a fraudulent claim. The random forest classifier was trained on the entire dataset with a 0.75 to 0.25 train-test ratio. Feature selection based on the Pearson correlation method was done prior
to training the classifier. Additionally estimates obtained from casual model were normalized and used as multipliers to discount/markup base premiums for policies recommended to clients. The
causal estimands for all variables were of the average treatment effect form. Backdoor linear regression method was used to find estimates for statistical estimands. This approach has helped
achieve the aim of the project which is to simplify policy purchase and claim processing for clients while providing personalized policy recommendations based on their profile. The interface of the app is easy to use and includes simple forms
and decent displays that the client can get used to.
